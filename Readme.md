## Kubernetes Visualizaiton techniques of Spcialized Resources

**Author/Coder Anthony Sheller**

**Overview**

This project sets up the Kubernetes environment to review visualizaiton of specialized resources, such as GPU and high-speed networking that are used to accelerate containerized applications. The applications discussed are Prometheus, DCGV, and Streamlit.

**Requirements** 
A running cluster. There are many ways one could  get one setup. There is no one-way to do this. There is too much detail that can go into setting up a Kubernetes cluster. The author/coder chose to start with Docker Desktop/Kubernetes running on Windows 10. This is very easty to get installed and setup.
